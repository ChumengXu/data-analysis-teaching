This analysis needs a code review by attendees at the short course "Tools for Reproducible Real 
World Analyses" at ISPOR Europe 2018.

```{r setup}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = FALSE)
```

## Formatted Tables
```{r cars2}
knitr::kable(summary(cars))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
