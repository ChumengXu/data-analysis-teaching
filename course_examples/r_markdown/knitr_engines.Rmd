This is a toy example.  There are many better ways to share data between languages.  Rstudio also recently put out a 
great package called `Reticulate` which makes it easier to weave together Python and R.

## Sharing Data (start with R)
```{r}
head(mtcars)
write.csv(mtcars, "./markdown_data/mtcars.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```
 
## Read to Python and Clean
```{python, python.reticulate = FALSE}
import pandas
 
mtcars = pandas.read_csv("./markdown_data/mtcars.csv")
mtcars_clean = mtcars[mtcars['cyl'] == 6]
 
print(mtcars_clean.head(10))
 
# Write to csv file for reading from R
mtcars_clean.to_csv("./markdown_data/mtcars_python.csv")
```
 
## Read in R
```{r}

mtcars_python <- read.csv("./markdown_data/mtcars_python.csv", header = TRUE)
          
head(mtcars_python)
